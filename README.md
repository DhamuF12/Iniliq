How to Install
--------

If you don't have composer, you have to [install it](http://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#installation).  

Add or complete the composer.json file at the root of your project, like this :

```json
{
    "require": {
        "pixel418/iniliq": "0.1"
    }
}
```

Iniliq can now be [downloaded via composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#installing-dependencies).

The last step is to include it in your PHP file :

```php
require_once( './vendor/pixel418/iniliq/iniliq/Iniliq.php' );
```
